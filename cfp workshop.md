Software is eating the world, but do engineers have the knowledge of their domain to bear the responsibility of transferring domain knowledge to a domain language? The rosetta stone of software is to have a domain language that clearly communicates in the language of the field, but many struggle to get past communication problems:

- Misunderstood requirements
- Code that does not capture intent properly
- Unintended consequences of poorly modeled data

Our workflows and structures create communication barriers we must break down in order to move the implementations closer to their domains. As developers, our goal should be to move code to a state of the vocabulary of the domain. This requires understanding not only the problem being solved by a feature but a broader understanding of the field we are working in. 

Design thinking offers a toolset for gathering insight into the domain that can not only help engineers understand a user's problem more fundamentally, it can also offer byproducts such as: 

- A clear path to a domain language
- Understanding problem nuance
- Gaining lessons learned of the user
- Providing a better understanding of the entire domain

This workshop walks attendees through a design thinking exercise with an emphasis on being the engineer in the room. As a result, you'll be more equipped to develop domain-centric data structures, domain languages, better database structures, and clearer documentation with more user validation. After taking this exercise back to your team, you'll have better long-term understanding of the codebase and product.
